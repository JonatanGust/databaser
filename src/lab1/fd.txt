Parentheses are used to separate attributes which have the same name as any other attribute.
Of course this may seem like a table reference but in actuality it's just names taken from the domain description.

R:
  name (Of a Country), name (Of  an Area), country (of an area), population (of an area), personNr, name (Of a Person), country (of a person), budget,
  location_country (of a person), location_area (of a person), name (of a language), roadID, tax, pointA_area, pointA_country, pointB_area, pointB_country,
  personnummer_owner (of a road), country_owner (of a road), hotelID, price, name (of an hotel), location_country (of an hotel), location_area (of an hotel),
  personnummer_owner (of an hotel), country_owner (of an hotel)

We see that  3 through 7 is the "same" dependency, just using different "naming" of the keys which probably indicates that there are quite a few references to this
table. Same goes for 8-10, 11-12 and 13-14. This is because we store the same kind of information for different reasons/uses which of course are violations of both
BCNF and 3NF. This indicates that we should remove all but one of these dependencies, this can be easily done by splitting up the table by each FD and then remove
the redundant ones.
