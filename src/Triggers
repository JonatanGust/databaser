INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE Roads:
Likewise, if a road (A--B) is about to be deleted, either A->B or B->A may be present in the Roads table. You should remove whichever one of those is present.

When a road is created by a Person, ensure that that Person is located at either the startpoint or endpoint of that road, and deduct the price of the road (getval('roadprice')) from that Person's budget.

Finally, make sure that only the roadtax field in a road can be updated, since the game does not allow a road to change the startpoint, endpoint or owner.
